Zoo is used to create and maintain collections of files in compressed form. It uses a Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm that gives space savings in the range of 20% to 80% depending on the type of file data. Zoo can store and selectively extract multiple generations of the same file.

This package exists for its historical value. If you are looking for a compression tool for serious use, check tar and gzip.
